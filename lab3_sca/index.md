# Lab 3: 3rd Party Code Analysis
In this lab, we will explore some examples of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, and how to remediate them. 

{: .important-title }
> Prerequisites
>
> We will be using our __TotallySecure__ project, which is available at https://github.com/HsecCx/workshop-TotallySecure. If you have not already done so, clone the project to your local machine, as defined in [Lab 1](../lab1_setup/).

## Introduction

With the accelerating adoption of open source software in their applications, organizations face the challenges of securing their applications when using open source or 3rd party dependencies. With Checkmarx Software Composition Analysis, organizations can better track, assess, and remediate their 3rd party package vulnerabilities and licensing risks within their projects before it's too late.

Checkmarx SCA supports all major ecosystems and package managers. A comprehensive list of supported languages and package managers can be found [here](https://checkmarx.com/resource/documents/en/34965-117822-supported-languages-and-package-managers.html).

### What is SCA?

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scans your application's dependencies to identify:
- **Known vulnerabilities** in open source packages
- **License compliance** issues and risks  
- **Outdated packages** with security patches available
- **Malicious packages** and supply chain attacks

Unlike SAST which analyzes your custom code, SCA focuses on the security of the third-party components your application depends on.

## Open the TotallySecure Project

1. Within VS Code, navigate to __File__ > __Open Folder...__ and select the folder to which you had previously cloned the workshop-TotallySecure. (e.g. ~/workshop-TotallySecure or %USERPROFILE%\\workshop-TotallySecure)

2. VS Code will open the __workshop-TotallySecure__ folder within the explorer, where you can see the project files

## Reviewing SCA Results

Within the Checkmarx VS Code plugin, ensure you are connected to the project, branch, and scan result as noted in the __Connect to a project__ section in [Lab 1](../lab1_setup/).

Malicious Packages will always be returned in SCA Critical results. We look at malicious packages in a different lab in [Lab 4](../lab4_malicious_packages/)

1. Navigate to the Checkmarx Plugin in the left menu of VS Code and expand the latest scan result

2. Expand the __sca__ section to view Software Composition Analysis results

3. The plugin gives you the capability to group results in several different ways. For this exercise, we will use grouping by severity. Look for the grouping dropdown or icon in the SCA results panel and select "Group by Severity"

    ![SCA Group By Severity](./assets/images/group_by_severity.png "SCA Group By Severity")

4. Expand the __Critical__ section to see the most severe vulnerabilities

    ![SCA Critical Results](./assets/images/sca_critical_results.png "SCA Critical Results")

5. Expand the __Maven-org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-coyote-9.0.22__ result to see the specific vulnerabilities in this package

6. Choose __CVE-2020-1938__ and review the description within the pane opened within VS Code.

    ```
    When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.  
    ```

7. We can see the recommended remediation is to __Upgrade To Version 9.0.107__. Additionally there is a link to the vulnerable package path, which is found within deploy/pom.xml. Click on __deploy/pom.xml__.

    ![SCA Tomcat Result](./assets/images/sca_tomcat_result.png "SCA Tomcat Result")

8. Within the __deploy/pom.xml__ file, we can update the Tomcat version from __9.0.22__ to version __9.0.107__.

    While Checkmarx SCA will often have recommendations to upgrade package versions to address found vulnerabilities, we understand it's not always as simple as just changing a version. We recommend when upgrading package versions, you do so one at a time in a test or staging environment and performing a regression test to ensure no functionality is broken or lost within your application. In the event that application functionality is affected, we recommend you coordinate with your internal Security organization to define a remediation plan or implement other mitigation steps to minimize the impact of the vulnerability.

## Learning more about SCA Results

1. Aside from built-in result information within the Checkmarx Plugin in VSCode, there is a wealth of information available on [Checkmarx's DevHub, devhub.checkmarx.com](https://devhub.checkmarx.com):

    ![DevHub](./assets/images/devhub.png "DevHub")

2. You can see this same result available within the [Vulnerabilities Database](https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/CVE-2020-1938/).

3. In addition to DevHub, Checkmarx also can provide email notifications of when new vulnerabilities arise related to previously discovered packages within your projects
