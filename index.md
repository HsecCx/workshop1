# Welcome to CxWorkshops

Welcome to CxWorkshops, Checkmarx's interactive labs for learning about and getting hands-on with Checkmarx products and solutions. Whether you're an existing Checkmarx customer or evaluating Checkmarx for your application security needs, we have a lab for it!

These interactive labs are intended to be instructor or proctor-led, however the content is freely available, should you wish to try the labs in your own environment or in your own time.

When attending a virtual or in-person workshop, you will need to login to the example tenant once to create a username and password. Once that is complete, these can be used to login via the IDE.  You can also use an api key, see: [Generating an API Key](https://docs.checkmarx.com/en/34965-118315-authentication-for-checkmarx-one-cli.html#UUID-a4e31a96-1f36-6293-e95a-97b4b9189060_section-idm4569983999729633242214461029)
