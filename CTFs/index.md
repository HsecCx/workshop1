# Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges

Welcome to the Checkmarx CTF series - designed for developers seeking to master secure coding practices and integrate security seamlessly into their development workflow.

## Overview

These CTF challenges help developers understand vulnerabilities from a **development perspective**. All challenges use the same comprehensive vulnerable application and focus on practical skills developers need: identifying security issues in code, understanding remediation techniques, and building security awareness into the development lifecycle.

## Application & Project

For these CTF challenges, you will use the **TotallySecure** application - a comprehensive vulnerable Java Spring Boot application designed to teach all aspects of secure development:

### **TotallySecure Application**
- **Repository**: `https://github.com/HsecCx/workshop-TotallySecure.git` 
- **Technology**: Java Spring Boot application with comprehensive security challenges
- **Associated Application**: TotallySecure Application (in ASPM)
- **Developer Focus Areas**:
  - **Supply Chain Security**: Dependency vulnerabilities, malicious packages, transitive dependencies
  - **Secure Coding Patterns**: Code vulnerability remediation, real-time security feedback, AI-assisted development
  - **Security Leadership**: Risk-driven development decisions, team security integration, ASPM analysis

**Why TotallySecure?** This application contains a rich variety of vulnerability types across multiple security domains (SAST, SCA, configuration), making it perfect for comprehensive developer security training. All three CTF challenges will explore different aspects of this same codebase, allowing you to develop deep expertise with one application while learning diverse security skills.

## CTF Challenge Series

The three CTF challenges are designed with progressive difficulty and scope:

| Challenge | Duration | TotallySecure Focus | Skills Developed |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Supply Chain Detective**  | 15-30 min | SCA & Dependency Security | Package security, dependency analysis, supply chain awareness |
| **Vulnerability Hunter**  | 15-30 min | SAST & AI-Enhanced Development | Code vulnerability identification, AI-assisted remediation, plugin mastery |
| **Security Development Lead**  | 15-30 min | ASPM & Development Leadership | Multi-domain security, risk prioritization, team leadership |

## Prerequisites

Before attempting these CTF challenges, developers should have:

- **Completed Labs 1-5**: Foundation knowledge of Checkmarx One platform and tools
- **Access Verification**: Confirmed access to TotallySecure project and its associated application in ASPM
- **Tool Familiarity**: Comfort with VS Code, Checkmarx plugin, and development workflows

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing the CTF series, developers will have demonstrated:

### **Secure Development Skills**
- Vulnerability identification and remediation techniques
- Secure coding pattern implementation
- Real-time security feedback integration with development workflows
- Dependency security and supply chain awareness

### **Development Workflow Integration**
- Security tool integration in daily development
- Risk-based development decision making
- Collaborative security practices with teams
- Proactive security mindset in feature development

### **Professional Growth**
- Security-aware development leadership
- Effective communication about security risks and solutions
- Prioritization of security work within development cycles
- Mentoring team members on secure development practices

## CTF Format

Each CTF follows a structured format designed for developer skill building:

- **Scenario Setup**: Real-world development context and challenges
- **Hands-on Phases**: Time-boxed coding and analysis exercises
- **Flag Capture**: Specific deliverables demonstrating secure development skills
- **Development Integration**: How to apply learnings in daily development work

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone TotallySecure**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HsecCx/workshop-TotallySecure.git
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code** and connect to Checkmarx project:
   - Project: `TotallySecure`
   - Branch: `master`

3. **Verify All Scanners** are complete:
   - SCA: Enabled âœ“
   - SAST: Enabled âœ“  
   - ASCA: Real-time feedback âœ“
   - ASPM: Dashboard active âœ“

4. **Ensure GitHub Copilot** is installed and active for AI-assisted development
