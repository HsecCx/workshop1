# CxWorkshops - Checkmarx Security Training Labs

A comprehensive hands-on workshop series designed for customers and partners to learn Checkmarx's application security solutions through practical, instructor-led labs.

## Overview

CxWorkshops provides interactive training labs covering the complete spectrum of Checkmarx One's application security capabilities. Using the **TotallySecure** vulnerable Java Spring Boot application as a demonstration project, participants gain hands-on experience with real-world security scenarios and remediation techniques.

## Workshop Structure

### Core Training Labs
- **Lab 1**: Environment Setup - IDE configuration and Checkmarx plugin installation
- **Lab 2**: Custom Code Analysis (SAST) - Static application security testing and AI-assisted remediation
- **Lab 3**: 3rd Party Code Analysis (SCA) - Software composition analysis and dependency security
- **Lab 4**: Malicious Package Detection - Supply chain attack prevention and detection
- **Lab 5**: Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) - Comprehensive risk management and prioritization

### Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges
Progressive security challenges designed for developers:
- **Supply Chain Detective**: SCA & dependency analysis, malicious package detection
- **Vulnerability Hunter**: SAST, AI-enhanced development, interface mastery, ASCA integration
